## Talks

- _Integrating Staphopia into S. aureus genomic investigations (February 2021)_  
A brief talk presented by [Dr. Robert A Petit III](https://www.robertpetit.com) at the [Virtual _S. aureus_ Seminar Series Early Career Symposium](https://twitter.com/Keenan__Lacey/status/1352391835994509314), demonstrating how you can use [Staphopia](https://staphopia.emory.edu/) for the analysis of _S. aureus_. Staphopia is now a part of Bactopia.
